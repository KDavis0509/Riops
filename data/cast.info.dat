#  lon          is the longitude of the station
#  lat          in the latitude of the station
#  cast          is a character string corresponding to either MINIDAS cast number
#                or file extension generated by the WAP from DH4 archive file  (e.g. "001")
#  Time0.CTD     is a character string for CTD start time.
#                (e.g."2015-05-06 12:18:01" or NA)
#  Time0.LISST   is a character string for the time 0 of the LISST
#                (e.g."2015-05-06 12:18:01" or NA)
#  minx          is the index of the CTD corresponding to the start of the profile
#                (if NA, the user willbe prompt to select the index manually)
#  maxx          is the index of the CTD corresponding to the End of the profile
#  Zint          is the depth interval for profile smoothing
#  depth.interval.for.smoothing  is the depth in meter that will be used to
#                 smooth data with loess.
#  asph.skip     is the number or records to skip at the begining of an asphere file.
#                This is necessary when the asphere file contain 2 or more profiles.
#  maxbb         is a parameter for the plots generated in the report.
#  Ndepth.to.plot is the number of depth to plot spectral IOP in the report.
